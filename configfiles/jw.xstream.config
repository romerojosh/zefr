# Makefile.in for ZEFR
# Simply substitute what you need here for compilation. It is suggested that 
# you end all directory paths with a forward slash (/) to avoid issues with 
# whitespace in the Makefile.
#
# Notes: 
# - This code requires an OpenMP aware C++ compiler. 
# - If using a multithreaded BLAS, like OpenBLAS, you should force it to run
#   single threaded, as it will cause performance issues otherwise. For example, 
#   using OpenBLAS, you can export the following environment variable:
#   	export OPENBLAS_NUM_THREADS=1

# Target Architecture (CPU or GPU).
ARCH = GPU

#Using OpenMP (YES or NO)
OPENMP = NO

# Use MPI (YES or NO)
MPI = YES

# MPI library is CUDA-aware? (YES or NO)
CUDA_AWARE = YES

# Turn verbose compilation warnings on/off (YES or NO)
WARNINGS = NO

# Set debug level - 1: -g,-O3; 2: -g,-O0; 0: Turn off -g, use -Ofast
DEBUG_LEVEL = 0
