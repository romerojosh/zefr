# Makefile.in for ZEFR
# Simply substitute what you need here for compilation. Directories should
# point to the top build directory, include and bin will be added in the Makefile.
#
# Notes: 
# - This code requires an OpenMP aware C++ compiler.
# - If using a multithreaded BLAS, like OpenBLAS, you should force it to run
#   single threaded, as it will cause performance issues otherwise. For example, 
#   using OpenBLAS, you can export the following environment variable:
#   	export OPENBLAS_NUM_THREADS=1


# Target Architecture (CPU or GPU).
ARCH = CPU   

# Using OpenMP (YES or NO)
OPENMP = NO 

# BLAS Type and Path (STANDARD, OPENBLAS, or ATLAS)
BLAS = OPENBLAS 
BLAS_DIR = /usr/local/Cellar/openblas/0.2.13

# CUDA Path
CUDA_DIR = /cm/shared/apps/cuda65/toolkit/6.5.14
